## Dev notes

### includes:
- honoka (s≈çzu control plane) (eventually)
- maki (music server)
- nozomi (frontend)
- umi (lyrics) - (not public)
- eli (remote control server) for "muse remote" feature

### what's next? (hopefully)

- music recommendation engine
- music-specific analytics

### wanna contribute? here are some things to consider!

- [GitMoji](https://gitmoji.dev) is heavily recommended. It helps with autogenerating things like release notes.

- Umi shouldn't be necessary to run anything, it's just an add-on. The frontend should fail silently if it can't connect to Umi.

- If you want to just develop a certain part, you should be able to run 'production' versions of everything via the docker-compose file.
