## what's next?

- music recommendation engine

## wanna contribute? here are some things to consider!

- [GitMoji](https://gitmoji.dev) is heavily recommended! please use it! it actually helps and is not just a gimmick!

- Ports: Maki is 3033, Umi (if you have access) is 3032, Nozomi is 3031.

- Umi shouldn't be necessary to run anything, it's just an add-on.
